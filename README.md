# Fractal Tree :evergreen_tree:

Fractals are theoretically infinite or self-replicating structures. There are several types of fractals, in this repository we will deal with the factual tree, one of the simplest types of fractals.

## Explanation :page_with_curl:

The fractal ree is generated by simple rules:

- An initial branch (trunk) is generated.
- From this branch `n` branches are generated.
- The branches generated have spacing (angulation) equal to each other.
- The generated branches branches also generate `n` branches.

Whe can have different visual results if we change variables:
- Branches number.
- Branches size.
- Angle.

## Guide :memo:

### Install

To execute the code you'll have to install the libraries `pygame` and `numpy`.

You can install using pip on terminal:

- Pygame

        pip install pygame

- Numpy

        pip install numpy


Go to `main.py` file and run it.

### Controls

- `Left Arrow` / `Right Arrow` increase and decrease the angle.

- Key `w` / Key `s` increase and decrease the number of branches.

- `Up Arrow` / `Down Arrown` increase and decrease the size of branches.
